        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The stars were glittering as if engraved on the cloud-free sky above the Main Building in Tsinghua University tranquilly. Tsinghua students rode their bikes to their homes and dreams, wrapped by thick clothes in the crisp winter night clear and cold, which was inevitably joked as one of the most intriguing scenes was Tsinghua publicized as a famous resort.</p><p><img src="/images/seventh-blog/1.jpg" alt></p><p><strong><em><center>Yong Qiu, the president of Tsinghua University, gave the speech at the Tsinghua Hall. Source: THU-ICCSD</center></em></strong></p><p>In contrast to what seemed like the normal Tsinghua, the noisy atmosphere inside the hall of the Main Building hinted something grand would possibly happen. Rushing staffs, high-end cameras mounted on the tripods, and small windows glimpsed in the computer screens foretold the opening of a splendour ceremony. </p><p><img src="/images/seventh-blog/2.jpg" alt></p><p><strong><em><center>Bin Yang, the vice president of Tsinghua University gave the speech at the award ceremony. Source: THU-ICCSD.</center></em></strong></p><p>All truth surfaced with such atmosphere culminating at the beginning of the ceremony. Mirrored in eyes was the award ceremony of the academic track of this summit hosted by Bin Yang, the vice president of Tsinghua University. Zhu Deng, a member of the Carbon Monitor team, who participated in the <a href="https://climatex2021.gauc.net/"><strong>global youth summit on net-zero future</strong></a> organized by the Global Alliance of Universities on Climate (GAUC), was urgently waiting for the official announcement of the best paper awardees, emanating little nervousness. Excited as he knew he won the best paper awards with an exhilarating smiling face, he gave the speech at the summit’s award ceremony, representing all best paper awardees. </p><p><img src="/images/seventh-blog/3.jpg" alt></p><p><strong><em><center>Zhu Deng gave the speech at the award ceremony. Source: THU-ICCSD.</center></em></strong></p><p>First, Zhu Deng introduced the Carbon Monitor project behind this award-winning work. Under the supervision of Prof. Zhu Liu and the tremendous efforts put by all team members, Zhu Deng and his colleagues built a carbon data monitoring system, called the <a href="https://carbonmonitor.org"><em>Carbon Monitor</em></a>, which enabled us, for the first time, to track the near-real-time carbon emissions from human activities. This dynamic dataset system is derived from various real-time activity data, including the national hourly electricity data, traffic data over 400 cities worldwide, real-time global flight status, etc. They found that, due to the global lockdown, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a nearly 9% decline in carbon emissions in the first half-year of 2020. It was the largest emission drop ever recorded since the pre-industrial level. However, a dramatic emissions rebound has been precisely captured by the Carbon Monitor, whose latest data showed that global carbon emissions have almost bounced back to the pre-pandemic level. These precious data have been posted on Twitter with a high volume of re-tweet and like, accompanying the heated and focused discussions of the general public. </p><p><img src="/images/seventh-blog/4.jpg" alt></p><p><strong><em><center>Latest data of the Carbon Monitor project. Source: Twitter.</center></em></strong> with <a href="https://twitter.com/LiuzhuLiu/status/1444993761138728965?s=20"><strong><em>waves of re-tweets</em></strong></a>.</p><p>In his speech, Zhu Deng advocated for young scholars that we younger generation should lead more far-reaching research on climate change, to enhance our scientific understanding of that, and to take firm and sound practical actions purposed for its mitigation. Youth should explore every possibility from our actions. It was the era for the younger generation to tackle this challenge regarded as the biggest threat to humanity in the 21st century.</p><p><img src="/images/seventh-blog/5.jpg" alt></p><p><strong><em><center>Official photography in the closing ceremony.

The data in this research was utilized to illustrate the global temporary reduction in daily CO2 emissions by Prof. Kai Chen in Yale University in the keynote section of this sub-forum by accident. Our team really thanked Prof. Chen for his recognition of this project, and he thanked our team for its excellent work contributing to the community of climate change.</p><p><img src="/images/seventh-blog/6.jpg" alt></p><p><strong><em><center>Interaction of our team and Prof. Chen, the invited speaker in the keynote section, Yale sub-forum.

Indeed a recognized latter one under the spotlight. The data of the Carbon Monitor have already been widely used in various authentic medias and officials, including the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), whose previously published <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021"><strong>Emissions Gap Reports 2021</strong></a> sourced the data, the World Meterological Organization (WMO) which published <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/resources/united_in_science"><strong>United in Science 2021</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/travel/tourism-2020-coronavirus.html"><strong><em>the New York Times</em></strong></a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2021/greenhouse-gas-emissions-pledges-data/"><strong><em>the Washington Post</em></strong></a>, <a href="https://media.nature.com/original/magazine-assets/d41586-020-01497-0/d41586-020-01497-0.pdf"><strong><em>Nature</em></strong></a>. Increasingly permeating focus on this dataset was exploding, highlighting the significance of how it could help reveal the imminent responses of carbon emissions to human activities and the impacts of human activities to carbon emissions interactively.</p><p>The award ceremony of this summit solemnly progressed in the China Enterprise Hall, sited at sunshine-bathed Glasgow, where <a href="https://ukcop26.org/"><strong>COP26</strong></a> is being hosted with people worldwide gathering to witness how climate change will be tackled in the near future. COP26 is where the senior experts discuss the future of climate while this data is worth being the robust scientific evidence for their policy-making. Maybe this is serendipitously a coincidence but against the backdrop, reveal some veiled fated interactions between these two.</p><p>Taochun Sun, another team member of the Carbon Monitor, is the group leader of the department of international communications in the Graduate Union of Tsinghua. He has put tremendous effort into organizing the entire summit and the previous Sino-US youth dialogue whose purpose was to preheat discussions about this summit and the COP26. He was involved in and led numerous efforts of great significance, including the drafting and revising of the preface of Conference Handbook of the <a href="https://sayouthdialogue.com/"><strong>Sino-US youth dialogue</strong></a>, the initial drafting and later revising of the bilingual version of the speech manuscript of Bin Yang, the vice president of Tsinghua University during this summit, the polishing of Zhu Deng’s speech manuscript, and the review of works for this summit, etc. Notably, he got several thank letters for Tsinghua University when communicating with allied universities based on his excellent communication skills. </p><p><img src="/images/seventh-blog/7.jpg" alt></p><p><strong><em><center>Thank letter from one of the allied universities.</center></em></strong></p><p>He expressed sincere gratitude for having this precious opportunity to help organize this series of climate-change-related activities and events, publicized officially by <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202110/09/WS6160f15fa310cdd39bc6dc20.html">China Daily</a>, Xinhua Agency and other media outlets. </p><p><img src="/images/seventh-blog/8.jpg" alt></p><p><strong><em><center>Taochun Sun expressed his gratitude for immersed participation in this dialogue. Source: Twitter.</center></em></strong><a href="https://twitter.com/TaochunSun/status/1447603032003338253?s=20"><strong><em>More Details</em></strong></a></p><p>This series of activities and events, including the summit and the dialogue, aims to provide a world-class stage for youth talents dedicated to carbon neutrality, and to contribute the power of universities to different carbon neutrality goals proposed nation-wisely. It will be of far-reaching impacts on the global efforts of climate change in the future.</p><p>It was 10 pm, when all the laughs, surprises waned, which was the prologue that all the expectations for the bright future waxed. In COP26, the future facing humanity was still being discussed with multilateral collaborations emerging as the fruits of senior experts, covering documents and agreements from nations and the United Nations. Youth hope all research-inspired policies and actions stemming from those really help someday for one of those purposes, maybe including building the community of shared future for mankind, right?</p><p>Writing: Taochun Sun</p><p>Reviewing: Zhu Deng and Taochun Sun</p><p>Acknowledgement: Prof. Zhu Liu</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2020年4月15日，自然界最强有力的一种光，伽马射线，像暴风雨前一样冲刷了整个太阳系。第一次接触是在火星上方，那里的光子具有与核弹辐射相当的能量，不断撞击NASA火星Odyssey探测器上的一个俄罗斯造粒子探测器；六分钟后，其爆发“照亮”了太阳与地球之间的太阳风探测器；此后五秒钟，信号进入地球表面上的专用检测器。</p><p><img src="/images/six-blog/1.jpg" alt></p><p>伽马射线爆发并不罕见。空间望远镜每天或每两天都能收到一次信号。其中约三分之二的爆发持续数十或数百秒，来自超新星爆发的大质量恒星。剩下的为不到2秒钟的短暂爆发，被认为是由两个中子星&#60;超新星爆发后中心留下的“遗迹”&#62;的灾难性碰撞引起的。但是，当天体物理学家注意到，4月15日的爆发事件在几毫秒钟内其亮度在微妙地不停发生变化时，他们认为这个神秘的源头可能是以前未知的。</p><p>这次爆发也很罕见离我们较近。通过对信号在不同探测器处的到达时间进行三角测量，天文学家将其追溯到一个邻近星系，玉夫座星系&#60;Sculptor&#62;。所有的证据都指向一种传奇但难以捉摸的事件：一个巨大的耀斑从一颗磁星&#60;具有异常强磁场的中子星&#62;上的爆发。</p><p>2021年1月，理论天体物理学家正在寻找一种无法解释的天体爆炸的“引擎”，备选从奇异的伽马射线闪光到强力的无线电波爆发，磁星则成为理论天体物理学家的首选答案。此时，这次爆发于一系列1月份发布的新研究中进行了剖析。“最初，这是一个非常晦涩的主题，”乔治华盛顿大学的天文学家Chryssa Kouveliotou说。“但是现在几乎在所有事物中都涉及了磁星。”磁星是在超新星内形成的，其磁场强度比冰箱用磁铁高一万亿倍，强度足以将X射线光子分裂或将正常原子拉伸为椭圆形。当这些场纠缠在一起时，磁星可以释放出大量能量，足以横跨宇宙发射辐射爆。</p><p>然而，有关电磁耀斑的实际数据仍然很少。银河系中及其附近发生的三起较早的磁星爆炸释放出的闪光如此明亮，它们“淹没了”探测器，甚至使某些航天器进入“安全模式”。这让天文学家除了知道有一次爆炸外，不知道其余任何细节。如果爆炸的源头太远，信号会微弱到无法确认。</p><p>科学家们耐心地等待着一次靠近我们，但也不能太靠近我们的磁星爆发，终于迎来了玉夫座耀斑事件。这一事件为长期存在的问题提供了线索，这些问题涉及在更广阔的宇宙中普通磁星可能有多常见，以及它们如何为巨大的耀斑爆炸提供动力。赖斯大学的天体物理学家Matthew Baring表示：“这就像是您坐在洛杉矶的一个地方，那里地震了，而且地震虽震级较低但一直在持续。突然你感受到了一次大地震，这次的耀斑事件就相当于‘大地震’”。</p><p>大约在人们还没有设想过磁星的四十年前，巨大的耀斑爆发第一次来临。在20世纪60年代后期的冷战中，美国的监视卫星偶然发现了一个令人惊讶的事实：伽玛射线闪光不仅来自下方的核试验，而且还来自上方的深空。到20世纪70年代，在对这些伽马射线爆发进行解密后，铁幕&#60;Iron Curtain&#62;两边阵营的天体物理学家都试图确定其在宇宙中的来源。<br>将伽马信号三角化来追溯其起源不仅需要跨越行星际距离的多个探测器，而且还需要克服地缘政治问题。到20世纪70年代后期，西方国家开始执行诸如环绕太阳的Helios任务和探测金星的Pioneer任务等；苏联在抛下金星着陆器后也曾有过在太阳系内部巡逻的Venera双胞胎探测器。在法国工作的美国天文学家Kevin Hurley创立了资料交换所，使NASA洛斯阿拉莫斯国家实验室的研究人员以及莫斯科的研究人员可以利用他作为中间人来收集信息，形成了所谓的行星际网络&#60;InterPlanetary Network&#62;。 赫尔利说：“当时合作不多，但也没有正式的禁令不准这样做。”</p><p>普通的伽马射线爆发一直在如下着毛毛雨一般来到地球。1979年3月5日，一瞬间的伽马射线脉冲比任何之前在苏联和美国航天器上看到过的伽马射线爆发都要亮100倍。信号交错的到达时间表明它来自银河系郊区的星系大麦哲伦星云。令人怀疑的是，银河系中含有一个已知的超新星残骸，在人们的预想中意味着它的中心有一颗中子星。爆发的余震持续了几分钟，每8秒钟重复一次，就好像伽马射线一直从一个致密的正在旋转的物体上的特定点射出。数年后，圣彼得堡的一个小组发现了来自同一天空的更微弱的X射线爆发，这暗示着这个神秘源仍在继续释放。</p><p>天文学家已经知道中子星是能上演极端爆发的极端致密物体。当一颗恒星的核心在超新星爆发时爆炸时，引力将一个太阳的质量压缩成一个20公里宽的球体。只有中子之间的量子排斥才能使其最终坍缩成一个黑洞。内爆还会“浓缩”先前存在的恒星的磁场，将其放大多达100亿倍。这些场为脉冲星提供动力，它们在旋转时以固定的间隔将无线电波扫过地球。但是要想获得像1979年那样的伽马射线爆，就需要一个更具磁性的物体。1992年，美国天体物理学家Chris Thompson和Robert Duncan，以及波兰的Bohdan Paczynski几乎同时想出了一种方法。他们考虑了在超新星爆发中诞生了10秒左右的婴儿中子星，它们太热了，以至于内部也融化了。对于一部分中子星，这种情况下形成的流体会搅动到足以使它们自己运动，这类似于为地球或太阳内部的磁场提供动力的旋转发电机。这个发电机将增强并锁定至比其它中子星强1000倍的磁场。“这太疯狂了。”天体物理学家Oliver Roberts说，“如果在月球和地球之间放置一颗磁星，它将吸走我们所有的信用卡并消除我们所有硬盘上的信息。”</p><p>当时，磁星仍为假说。 证明它们真实的一种方法是测试基于电磁定律的预测。磁星的强磁场应作为自旋的强大刹车，这样，每几毫秒旋转一次的磁星在短短的几千年内就会减速至每几秒旋转一次，就像1979年的信号明显旋转了8秒一样。当时在NASA的Kouveliotou开始通过在可疑的银河系磁星上训练X射线望远镜三年来实时记录这种减速。1998年，她发现事实上速度确实慢了大约百分之一秒，这证明了在野外确实存在Thompson和Duncan预言的理论野兽。她在公布该发现论文中包括了两位物理学家。她说：“他们非常高兴。他们‘被电离’了。” </p><p><img src="/images/six-blog/2.jpg" alt></p><p>从一开始，Duncan和Thompson还意识到强磁场可以消除巨大的耀斑，在1998年和2004年，银河系磁星再次向地球发射了两次灼热的伽玛射线爆后，理论家继续阐述了这种情况。经历最开始的暴动后，磁星的最上面几米会足够冷却（虽然仍达到数百万开氏度）以冻结中子，电子和原子核的晶格。随着电流的破裂和磁场线的穿透，地壳会“发抖”，有时会形成细小的裂纹，这些裂纹会将一小部分等离子体释放到恒星自身周围的磁化大气中。等离子体会发出X射线风暴脉冲，就像圣彼得堡小组观察到的那样。</p><p>但是在外壳之下，可能会形成更大的压力。人们认为，处于不同深度的洋葱状圈层以不同的速率旋转将导致磁场在层边界处相互摩擦，从而在地壳上施加巨大的力。Thompson说，偶尔，也许每个世纪一次或只有一次，那张应力中的表面可能会突然骤变：一场星震将重新排列中子星表面的一小部分，就像席卷了加利福尼亚和纽约的一场地震。</p><p>通过将磁极附近的大片地壳撕开，磁场的磁力线向太空中张开，一场大规模的星震可以瞬间吐出大量等离子体，使电子和正电子以相对论的速度飞向太空，接近光速。等离子体中会像头灯一样出现一束被提升到更高的能量，并通过等离子运动聚焦而成的紧密，短暂的光子束。等离子体中的电子会与光子发生碰撞，从而使它们达到伽玛射线强度。如果像这样的光束扫过地球，那么它们可能只是解释了这些不合适的伽马射线爆发。</p><p><img src="/images/six-blog/3.jpg" alt></p><p>16年的“干旱”后迎来了2020年4月份的巨大耀斑。观测人员终于可以用当今最先进的仪器检查这个事件的至少一部分。行星际网络仍在不断地循环进出太空探测器，定位爆发的源头来自玉夫座星系。这个距离使Hurley和他的合作者能够计算出耀斑的内在强度，这等同于将十万年的太阳光在短短几毫秒内发射。</p><p>随着爆发的闪烁，NASA费米探测器捕捉到的伽马射线光子的能量比以前在巨大耀斑中测得的任何能量高出几倍，并且表明它们在最明亮的时刻到达了。这是等离子体以足够高的速度运动所期望的效果，这时它们既会发光又会增强光子能量。</p><p>这反过来也证实了磁极附近爆炸的景象，这是磁场线可以使等离子体如此迅速逸出的唯一位置。在费米探测器上的另一种仪器，在主事件发生后19秒开始，以更高的能量捕获了一些伽玛射线。他们认为，一些喷射出的等离子体在产生最初的伽马射线束之后，继续与远处环绕磁星的气体层碰撞，从而引发强烈的余震。</p><p>对于路易斯安那州立大学天文学家Eric Burns而言，耀斑提供了一个机会，可以在伽玛射线以往目录中搜索类似事件。天文学家曾想到，还有其他一些爆发可能来自邻近星系&#60;如仙女座&#62;的巨大耀斑。但是，当爆发的坐标与附近的星系重叠时，人们永远不清楚事件是发生在那个星系中还是沿着同一视线更远的某个地方。许多天文学家预设这些爆炸是标准问题的短脉冲，很可能是更遥远距离的中子星碰撞所造成的。</p><p>Burns寻找非常短的，与最新地图中附近正在形成恒星的星系&#60;最有可能产生磁星的星系&#62;位置重叠的爆发。他发现了另外三个似乎确实来自银河系邻居的爆炸。这样一来，银河系附近可能存在的磁星大耀斑总数就达到了七个。根据他的计算，在整个宇宙中，巨大耀斑的发生频率应比所有类型的超新星的总和还要多，并且可能比中子星合并等其他奇异的瞬变要多1000倍。但是遥远宇宙中的巨大耀斑太微弱了以至于根本看不见，它们将大部分能量集中在少数非常高能量的光子中。他说：“这些事情非常普遍。事实证明，它们更难被发现。”</p><p>如果Burns的计算是对的，他们认为超新星爆发中通常确实会诞生具有超强磁场的中子星。此外，这暗示至少有百分之几的先前观测到的短伽玛射线爆实际上也是伪装着的巨大耀斑。最后，他们暗示有足够的爆发磁星来为从更遥远太空观察到的神秘的快速无线电爆发提供动力。这也是在2020年4月的第二次分水岭&#60;watershed&#62;磁星事件支持的一个情况：首次从中探测到一个已知的正经历一次小爆发的银河系磁星发出的微弱的类似于快速无线电波的信号。 </p><p>天体物理学家Brian Metzger表示：“可以用磁星来解释一切当然是玩笑话。但是很好的是，这些不同的东西似乎正融合在一起。”</p><p>以玉夫座耀斑为模板，天文学家希望从其他星系中收集更大数量的正释放耀斑的磁星的统计样本。Burns正在挖掘更多的档案数据来做到这一点，并希望即将到来的像StarBurst这样的伽玛射线天文台对更高能量的伽玛射线足够敏感，以区分巨大的耀斑与更常见的爆发。银河闪光，不管何时到来，都会有所帮助。它最初上升的强度仍会淹没灵敏的伽马探测器，但如今的引力波探测器也许能够吸收来自星震本身的时空涟漪，从而为磁星表面实际发生的情况提供更多线索。</p><p>不过，就目前而言，天文学家还停留在一些基本问题上，例如发射一个巨大耀斑的磁星是否有足够的磁能来激发另一个耀斑，这可能需要几个世纪的时间才能回答。“在我的一生里估计见不到了。”Hurley说。“但自从我开始在行星际网络工作，我变得更有耐心。”</p><p>Hurley仍在争取使用太空机构的及太阳系内的伽马射线探测器。他说，由于世界上有像费米和Swift这样的高科技伽玛射线天文台，NASA委员会对资助该项目的热情降低了，这使它的未来充满了疑问。但欧洲前往水星的Bepi-Colombo探测器将很快成为第33个参与的任务，而NASA对小行星的Psyche任务将在明年发射。它们携带的伽马射线探测器将准备就绪，以准备好迎接在黑暗中可能再次发生的罕见大镜头。</p><p>取材于：<br><em>Joshua

This goal needs to be supported by fruits based on the calculation of carbon accounting data. The results of this analysis can be in good agreement with the recent or near-current frontier progress in the field of carbon emissions, which reflects the application of <em>the Dialectics of Nature</em> in the frontier field of scientific research.</p><p><strong><em><center>Key Words</center></em></strong></p><center>Data analysis.

The basic principle or law is the judgment of the connection with basic concepts, the reflection of the basic relationships among the research objects, the foundation the scientific theories rely on to be established and developed. Logical inferences are logical conclusions deduced from these concepts and principles, that is, various specific laws and fore-sights. It functions as the explanations and fore-sighting of theories. This chapter also mentioned that the methodological significance of mathematics is to provide a concise and precise formal language for research and a tool for abstract thinking, to provide effective means for organizing and developing existing knowledge and subsequently establishing a scientific theoretical system, to provide means of quantitative analysis and theoretical calculation for scientific research. The above discussions give the author inspirations to analyze the carbon accounting and climate change issues currently being studied by the author from a dialectical perspective.</p><p>Climate change is the major environmental science issue facing human society in the 21st century. Previous studies have pointed out that global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are “very likely” to be the main cause of increasing climate change events$^{[2]}$. The cumulative carbon dioxide emissions have a linear relationship with the cumulative temperature rise after the pre-industrial stage$^{[3]}$, which accounted for 80% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from human activities$^{[4]}$. In the “14th Five-Year Plan”, China has clearly set emission reduction targets: carbon peaks in 2030 and carbon neutrality in 2060. Therefore, accurate and reliable carbon emission data can be the basic support and also the scientific basis for formulations of emission reduction policies and targets, which requires accurate carbon accounting methods to support it.<br>National carbon dioxide emission accounting is the basis for taking emission reduction measures, issuing national emission reduction strategies, and conducting international verification and evaluations. However, carbon dioxide itself is not included in air pollutants, meaning that there is no universal accounting system globally$^{[5]}$. To this end, international institutions such as the International Panel of Climate Change &#60;IPCC&#62; have formulated globally-widely-used methodologies to estimate national carbon dioxide emissions based on the consumption of numerous kinds of carbon-containing fossil energy and the carbon contents of the corresponding energy themselves respectively$^{[6]}$. Recommended carbon accounting methodologies from the IPCC include two types: reference approach and sectoral approach. Reference approach is to estimate emissions based on the total amount of energy consumption in a specific country, which can be calculated from energy production, import and export, and stock exchange. Sectoral approach is to calculate sector-wise emissions based on energy consumption for each sector, which eventually is added together to obtain the amount of national emissions$^{[5]}$. One of the cores of clarifying the methodologies underlying the carbon emission accounting is a group of mathematical formulations. Carbon emissions can be disaggregated into fossil-fuel carbon emissions and industrial process carbon emissions:</p><p><em><center>$carbon\_emissions=fossil\_fuel\_emissions+industrial\_process\_emissions$ &#60;1&#62;</center></em></p><p>Fossil fuel emissions can be calculated by equation &#60;2&#62; :</p><p><em><center>$fossil\_fuel\_emissions=activity\_data ( energy\_ consumption ) \\\times emission\_factors (carbon\_content\_in\_the\_energy\_sources)$ &#60;2&#62;</center></em></p><p>Because the emission factor for a specific energy source is associated with the quality, property and combustion efficiency of that source, that factor can be further disaggregated:</p><p><em><center>$emission\_factor=heating\_value \\\times carbon\_content\_per\_heating\_value \\\times oxidation\_rate (combustion\_efficiency)$ &#60;3&#62;</center></em></p><p>Carbon emissions from fossil fuels can be estimated from equation &#60;4&#62;:</p><p><em><center>$fossil\_fuel\_emission= activity\_data ( energy \_consumption )\\ \times heating\_value \times carbon\_content\_per\_heating\_value \\\times oxidation\_rate (combustion\_efficiency)$ &#60;4&#62;</center></em></p><p>Most of the industrial process part is the cement production process, whose basic rule of carbon accounting is similar to the fossil fuel counterpart, formulated as equation &#60;5&#62;:</p><p><em><center>$industrial\_process\_emissions=activity\_data ( cement\_production ) \\\times emission\_factor$ &#60;5&#62;</center></em></p><p>From the equations, it can be noted that the uncertainties of estimations of carbon emissions come from two aspects: activity level data &#60;energy consumption and industrial production&#62; and emission factors.</p><p>Throughout the basic rules and the methodologies concerning the carbon emissions accounting, we can dive into the following points. </p><p>First is the importance of basic concepts. Easy as it’s for the mathematical summary of accounting emissions &#60;eg. There doesn’t exist the concepts stemming from advanced mathematics such as calculus&#62;, the accounting of that is uneasy and even awesome, reflected by the diversifiedness of those basic concepts. Take the core equation, equation &#60;1&#62; as an example. What is the concept of fossil fuel? How to understand the activity data. Why is the content parenthesized in that equation noted as the energy consumption and what are the relationships between those? What is the emission factor? Understanding those terms is the most crucial fundamental to correctly grasping how to calculate emissions. </p><p>Second is the basic rules and therefore the logic inferences. Though the equations are not fraught with too many mathematical deductions and inferences, it demands high from the emissions-calculating practitioners to make clear the rules of carbon accounting because of the enduring issues surrounding the fully understanding of basic concepts. For instance, why are the operations used in the equations those of “adds” rather than “times/multiplications” ? This implicates the inferences of “mathematicalization” from the understanding of basic rules to the resultant formulations that can be practically reasonable, requires the foundational establishment of relationships between the logic based things even above the basic concepts and rules, and finally fulfill the obtainment of “right answers &#60;methodologies&#62;” . Resulting from those methodologies is the obedience to basic scientific rules, which can be further explained by logic.</p><p>This kind of thinking can be better surfaced by the equation &#60;3&#62;. Dissecting that equation, the basic concepts are: heating value, carbon content per heating value, oxidation rate. Departing from the starting line of the subject classifications, we can put more weight on the inspecting of terms used in that equation. Heating value is from physics whereas oxidation rate from chemistry. Although the concept of carbon content per heating value is truly newly-defined in terms of the nomenclature, the definition of that abides by the ratio definition method mostly utilized by physicists but resulting in a novelly conceptual term in the field of carbon accounting. Therefore, equation &#60;3&#62; is virtually a case study for the application of multi- or inter-disciplinary research, empathized by the resulting academic fruits that, based on the achievements from each subject, the achieving pathways from how to integrate them to solving a certain scientific question can be discovered to serve the purposes of scientific research for the current key questions from the perspective of effectively taking full advantage of knowledge from different subjects.</p><p>However, not only need in-depth and microscopically-investigating-style scientific research focus on the process of conceptualization and mathematicalization from rules to formulae but sufficiently get the essentials of how to actually make calculations based on that process. This transformation can be borrowed from what’s described in <em>the Structure of Scientific Revolution</em> as Kuhn’s paradigm, which is <strong><em>from pre-paradigm, the formation of paradigm, normal science, anomaly, crisis, a new paradigm to new normal science</em></strong>. Take carbon accounting as an example. The part of paradigm shift, from anomaly to crisis, from crisis to new paradigm, can be exemplified by the know-how of calculating the uncertainties of results. From the abovementioned paragraphs come two aspects influencing the uncertainties: activity level data and emission factors. Globally many institutes and universities have contributed to the carbon emission accounting, most notable and prestigious of which are: Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre &#60;CDIAC&#62;, European Commission’s Joint Research Centre &#60;JRC&#62;, Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency &#60;PBL&#62;, Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research &#60;EDGAR&#62;,  International Energy Agency &#60;IEA&#62;, U.S. Energy Information Administration &#60;EIA&#62;, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change &#60;UNFCCC&#62;, World Resources Institute &#60;WRI&#62; $^{[7]}$. They provide annual estimations of carbon emissions data, but in fact the carbon emissions emitted by human beings is indeed one certain value rather than the fact of “estimation after estimation” , which indicates the “existingness” of one “true” value $^{[8]}$ . So, why errors?</p><p>We can relate this to the analysis of uncertainties. The systemic errors from the national statistics data, the errors induced from in-situ measurements or estimations of the emission factors and other factors are the culprits of uncertainties. The judgement and modifications of statistical data and measurement errors can be analogy to the process of “anomaly-&#62;crisis-&#62;new paradigm”. In addition, besides errors, these two can be analysed for better granularity. In the field of carbon emissions, such granularity can be depicted by a concept, resolution, either spatially or temporally &#60;eg. more detailed &#60;granularized&#62; temporal resolution&#62;. Generally according to the theory of error propagation, increased resolution is commensurate with increased sampling frequency, beneficial to the reduction of inherent errors in the sampling process and the decreasing of extra costs for analysing errors &#60;in terms of data rather than methodologies&#62;. Carbon accounting is conditioned on the activity data and the emission factors. Considering that an emission factor for one substance can be re-regarded as the individual property because of the invariability of its chemo-physical property and the errors mainly come from making this property mathematically calculatable and assuming that it remains unchanged behind the high-temporal-resolution scene, the emission factor remains unchanged. By inversely inferring from the equations that we have mentioned to use to get the emissions, we can conclude that one of the approaches is to improve the temporal resolution of activity data. Therefore, high-resolution carbon accounting is one of the future directions, where we can more accurately run the process of carbon accounting to approximate the so-called <em>true</em> value.</p><p>Nevertheless, carbon accounting is basically a tool to measure the impacts of the running of human society on the earth environment and climate, but rather has overarching contributions to the temperature rise due to climate change. Human society is itself a macro-system, so is the earth. Behind the carbon accounting is a way to measure to leverage the impacts among macro-systems. Recalling from the system science theory, this kind of research needs to see the object as an organic whole, putting more weight on the coordination between localness and globalness, between specificness and generalization, between analysis and integrative-thinking; to see the object as a dynamic system, connecting its history, current status and future with the discreetness of combining stage-level thinking into continuity. Mixed optimization and systematic filtering are needed further to abstract the real system into the model&#60;s&#62; and get results from simulations and emulations. The high-resolution methodology considers the dynamic evolution of a system rather than results from one certain period &#60;eg. a year&#62;. There are studies pinpointing the abstraction of systems for modeling, including analysing pathways of emissions mitigation as for the coupling analysis of human socioeconomic development and carbon accounting. But those studies have failed to include the high-granularity temporal dynamics, which can be improved in the future. Finally, organic coordination is needed in scenarios where pathway analysis can couple human society into carbon accounting relevant to the human activity data and the reflection of human society running. So how can this inter-couplability be represented and researched in future studies? Do we need to emphasize the system where initially A is considered, and only after A is finished are we able to turn our head to B? Those are some points for carbon emission studies, inspiring from <em>the Dialectics of Nature</em>, which also can be something looked inside longitudinally in the future.</p><p><strong><em><center>The End</center></em></strong></p><p>This article analyses the applications of <em>the Dialectics of Nature</em> to the field of carbon emissions accounting by integrating some viewing points from the dialectics into scientific data analysis questions concerning the emission accounting. It also interprets the influences of such applications to the scientific advances and development in that field. Results show that dialectics implicitly and inadvertently plays significant roles in those research, and is an integral part of the development of science. </p><p><strong><em><center>Reference</center></em></strong></p><p>[1] Introduction to the Dialectics of Nature, 2018 version</p><p>[2] 马翠梅，徐华清，苏明山. 温室气体清单编制方法研究进展. <em>地理科学进展</em>，2013，32&#60;03&#62;：400-407.</p><p>[3] Rogelj J, Forster P M, Kriegler E, et al.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>The matter of time</em></strong> is the <strong>most unfathomable thing</strong> in the universe. From hundred years ago, physicists have been relentlessly hotly debating whether time is truly what it has brought to us and what we do feel in the reality. Some think it’s truly a <strong>hallucination</strong> bestowed by the most powerful embodiment of nature, others just have some ideas about the revealed <strong><em>infinitesimals</em></strong> of its seemingly existing intervals which can be an analogy to the quantum physics, too evident for us even to be able to recognize the flying of time. </p><p><img src="/images/fourth-blog/1.jpg" alt><br><em><center>Ceremony Rehearsal</center></em></p><p>Time is what everyone <em>cannot evade</em> and what thus makes everyone feel the most <em>uncontrollable</em>. Vicissitudes that can be <strong><em>an ineluctable cycle</em></strong> one empire <em>suffers</em>, <em>endures</em>, <em>is tortured</em>, and finally given <em>a fading moment</em> throughout the entire history by, like a <strong><em>bubble</em></strong> being <em>ferociously</em> thrown to a pellucid pool, though struggling to ricochet up, unfortunately at the end inundating in the bottom <strong>without any possible roars and rise</strong>, even one can crystal-clearly witness the entire process. Life and death concerning all the individuals, which <strong><em>no panacea</em></strong> can keep from approaching a healthy adult, and is what maybe one tries to <strong><em>construe</em></strong>, the profound philosophical meanings one <strong><em>scrambles to capture</em></strong> but <em>to no avail</em>, just as a life-long cycle which must have a beginning and an ending, <strong><em>the doom of the man</em></strong>. Even a star, which has already lived for years, cannot bypass <strong><em>the curse of time</em></strong>. However, stars are lucky enough. They explode at the very end of the winding river of their life, be it a <em>swelling fireball</em> that can engulf any planets in their host system to <strong><em>show their unparalleled predominant power</em></strong> even before finalizing disappearance, or a marvellously <strong><em>iridescent and energy-intensive carnival</em></strong> called supernova in the universe able to be captured by the people on the earth billions light-year away and whose powerfulness can be transmitted through the medium constituting the universe at the speed of the light, or a black hole which, as the astrophysics predicts, can be the only prison for the light trapped by the unrivalled pull of gravitation, and fantastically meditating, <strong><em>the end of time</em></strong>, <strong><em>the converge of events</em></strong>, <strong><em>the home of everything</em></strong>.</p><p><img src="/images/fourth-blog/2.jpg" alt><br><em><center>Commemoration</center></em></p><p><strong><em>Who knows?</em></strong> For the human being, the lifetime of 100 years is long enough to experience the process <em>from being an embryo warmed by your mom to pursuing the love and the conceived meaningfulness at any trying times</em>, <em>from kissing the soulmate even in a crisp winter morning to biding the last farewell to your 99-year-old father</em>, <em>from being the most glittering star among the crowd to hospitalizing with all the accompanying descendants who repeatedly say the gloriously courageous and romantic past of yours and show their most genuine love to you like the daffodil, kind of boasting the intriguingly present proudly made by themselves, though absolutely not outclassing and eclipsing yours, but also the ones that make you feel like you were travelling back the golden days through a time capsule, full of ambition and inspiration to the promising future.</em></p><p><img src="/images/fourth-blog/3.jpg" alt><br><em><center>Zijing Morning</center></em></p><p>However, there is a <strong><em>prestigious university</em></strong> that outlives <strong><em>most of us</em></strong>. Enduring the wax and wane of <strong><em>the recent era</em></strong>, the ups and downs of <strong><em>fates of individuals</em></strong>, the <strong><em>innovation, renovation and rejuvenation</em></strong> of China, it’s where I am living to so many strenuous efforts that cannot be explained and leave my eyes watering, and has so many mates that I could learn from and play with. It’s called Tsinghua University.</p><p><img src="/images/fourth-blog/4.jpg" alt><br><em><center>Ceremony Portrait</center></em></p><p>It’s <strong><em>ineffable</em></strong> to say how <strong><em>surreptitious</em></strong> I feel and how much responsibility I feel to bear to be one of the volunteers of the Tsinghua University 110th Anniversary Ceremony on both April 24th and April 25th. The sun follows the natural law with regular rises and sets. I am exactly standing on the Zijing playground as it rises and also exactly standing in the same location as it sets. <strong><em>Preparing for the supplies</em></strong> for all the people engaging in this ceremony is the <strong><em>insuperable task</em></strong> I first faced, including the national flags and university flags, bottles of water adorning the <strong><em>customized patterns</em></strong> etched with <strong><em>Tsinghua logos</em></strong>, glow sticks of good quality and functioning like an <strong><em>atmosphere renderer</em></strong> in the evening. Rationing all those supplies to different areas representing the partitioning of the playground is an <strong><em>arduous task</em></strong> with extreme <strong><em>carefulness, dexterity and indefatigability</em></strong> needed, just a backbone for the entire normal run of the ceremony. Safeguarding the northeast gate of the playground is a second task, preventing any other person unrelated to the ceremony from entering the center area of the playground. I was conferred a nickname “Gate Safeguarder” after April 25th. </p><p><img src="/images/fourth-blog/5.jpg" alt><br><em><center>Preparing for the Supplies</center></em></p><p>I watched the ceremony live on the playground, moved by the content of several shows. The most impressive is the <strong><em>impromptu 5-minute speech</em></strong> made by the academician <strong><em>Kezhi Huang</em></strong>, where he said it’s <strong><em>the faith of not disappointing his teachers</em></strong> that makes him <strong>strive for years</strong> to build a <strong>world-class research team</strong> for the cutting-edge field the country inescapably needs to develop in the past decades, which finally fulfilled his dream by making huge contributions to our country in terms of the academic fruits bearing and students training. This is acknowledged as the <strong><em>perseverance and romance of researchers in our country</em></strong> by most of my friends, who have devoted their lives to inculcate students and hold the tradition that their teachers inherit to them. Others include the elder <strong><em>TsinghuaRen</em></strong> in the Shanghai chorus singing together with “never never give up” rocketing to the sky full of stars, which encourages us to strive for the future never giving up, and the standing up of people who graduate from Tsinghua 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, respectively, and need to be <strong><em>solemnly respected</em></strong> because they have done so many possibly secret missions and tasks of the greatest significance, for the development of our country. In addition, happy birthday to Tsinghua University by the international students is a representation of the respects to our country by global communities, making me self-motivated and proud. </p><p><img src="/images/fourth-blog/6.jpg" alt><br><em><center>a Corner at the University</center></em></p><p>In addition to participating in the ceremony, I am also involved in the editing of the special issue of T+Z technology review, and the video recording of the COVID-19 vaccination at Tsinghua University. Exhausted as it seems inevitably for me, this cherishing experience can be a <strong><em>once-in-the-lifetime</em></strong> one that everyone indeed doesn’t want to miss and let slip without any action, <strong><em>the brightest stars in the sky</em></strong>. </p>]]></content>

      <title>The Road I Have Passed</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Preface"><a href="#Preface" class="headerlink" title="Preface"></a><strong><em>Preface</em></strong></h2><p>I am always a person, keen on <strong>collecting everything in the past of my life</strong>. Those are <em>so memorable, so cherishing</em>. </p><p>It’s <em>so revealing, interesting</em> to <strong>begin a wonderful work</strong> of putting some of those articles, paragraphs at this website, as a <strong>collection and memory of the past</strong>, which I have written during the period from <strong>entering the university, to graduating from it</strong>. Some of those writing contain lots of grammatical mistakes, indicating there exists <strong><em>a road of making progress</em></strong> for me that I have already passed.</p><h2 id="Begin…"><a href="#Begin…" class="headerlink" title="Begin…"></a><strong><em>Begin…</em></strong></h2><h3 id="Dairy-One-written-in-my-sophomore"><a href="#Dairy-One-written-in-my-sophomore" class="headerlink" title="Dairy One -> written in my sophomore "></a><center><i>Dairy One -> written in my sophomore </i></center></h3><p>I am rejoicing at I successfully go through the tough period of time when lots of midterm exams test my mental stability and my capacity in coping greatly with those questions where our teachers, totally I predict, want to know how detailed we review the knowledge we have acquired in the antecedent courses. In the linear algebra test, I failed to foresee the implications our teacher had given us that we should use our calculated a and b to replace the variables in that matrix. Although our teacher didn’t emphasize that, I thought it was normal to realize the fact, which I should have done. And maybe the outcome is so serious that perhaps I will manage to get very high marks to guarantee my ultimate semester grades, which somehow put me burdened a little. And in Rs and GIS tests I have lost some multiple choices, which reflects my persistent unpreparedness for those, which I’m accustomed to saying as a ‘detailed questions’. I will try to overcome it in the near future because I sometimes believe that whether you are focusing on details determines how promising your future is. Maybe they are not proportional to each other, but positively correlated I truly think.</p><p>I am wild with joy when yesterday I went to my senior high school, chatting with my high school mates. I found some of them liked to discuss questions in a very open way and understood what they are fighting for. Even if they were junior high schoolmates, they wanted to know more about the life in college and what I have been taught in my own major.Although they couldn’t sufficiently understand the knowledge in detail due to the non-profuse accumulation of the corresponding knowledge, they wanted to know it on their own understanding and tried to convert it into their own cognitive reasoning——-why could this field of major research be developed? Which aspects of the applications of major were related to our everyday life. Trying to give a vivid answer about what is remote sensing, I told to them that remote sensing was like an unusual processing of picture similar to using PS, but for most of the occasions, we usually processed the picture at the invisible wavelengths by manipulating the RGB bands with gray level. I spent lots of time explaining that to senior schoolmates, who maybe partook in the physical competitions able to know Rayleigh scattering and the attenuation in the atmosphere and even know some superficial theory of computer programming language, which impressed me so much. I was overjoyed with the chatting with all the schoolmates. I deem that the suggestions I give to them can help them forge a career they want and leave them more leeway for their future choice on the endless opportunities they will obtain and obstacles they maybe suffer, which I hope, the less the better.</p><p>I love taking a walk when I feel stressed and forced. And in this afternoon, I take some photos in Weiming Lake, which one of my extremely intimate friends appreciate a lot, also making me very happy because I think this is a recognition and acknowledgment for my ability to find beauty in our surroundings. It is a really good way to relieve the pressure I was always suffering during all kinds of midterms. At least, from now on, I feel I can be 100% energetic to be willing to try to surmount all of the difficulties I will encounter in the future, for example, final test? Good night.</p><p><img src="/images/third-blog/1.jpg" alt></p><h3 id="Futurest-versus-future"><a href="#Futurest-versus-future" class="headerlink" title="Futurest versus future"></a><center><i>Futurest versus future</i></center></h3><p>It’s a faith. It’s a warm family. It’s a truth. It’s a rewarding experience. It’s a meeting where we all assemble together to learn something, to practice something, to intuitively discover who we are and what kind of person we will be. It has a name of full salutation, the youth league school.</p><p>Youth League School is a magnificent platform, where lots of elites will come to our school and make several pieces of training for all of the participated, where movies or videos showing the tremendous development of China ranging from its innovative industries to agile nascent entrepreneurs are being displayed at the media center where we watch all these heated things with high spirit. Initially I feel a little depressed about this school because, you know, it occupies my weekend, when, on my convention, I will go home and have a very nice sleep in return for my exhausted brain and body, but now I feel like I should cherish and appreciate this unbelievable and precious school, offering me an opportunity to acquire more through the classes taught by those able to set an example for all of our teenagers.</p><p>During the 2-day school, I met one of the representative in the 19th Communist Party of China National Congress, an ingenious female teacher in Peizhi School situated in Tongzhou District. As a representative, she entirely went through the whole process where the speech draft was written and modified and completely finished by all the intellectuals. She shared with us her feelings about witnessing and participating in this, she emphasized, very impassioned phase, a sense of extreme passion, a sense of extreme touch, a sense of extreme pride, especially when she told us that Xi would enroll in every part of the meeting for check and approve prudently with scant regard to his body condition, with a demonstration of four applause icon in her PowerPoint. She told us the meaning of the 19th CPCNC and, the most important, the connotation of Chinese Dream.</p><p>The documentaries showing the innovative power and industrial strength of modern China draw the ubiquitous attention of all us. And I thought it was more commemorative for me because I gave a speech in front of all the mates on behalf of our college. I didn’t know why I suddenly wanted to lecture in front of the class, perhaps as I always focused on the latest creative inventions in China, all mentioned in this documentaries, which fully resonated me. The production of combustible ice, the maiden flight of C919, an enormous plane firstly made by China with lots of patent high-tech technology, and to my greatest rapture, a lot of newly invented things about astronomy, including FAST, Yutu lunar rover and so on. I thought I didn’t want to lecture until the presence of the Mozi quantum satellite because I truly want to summarize all these exciting inventions interspersed with some scientific introduction of those about astronomy.</p><p>What Mr. Bing told us was impressive too. As a leader of the Tsinghua University, he profoundly knew how the young league system worked and what we, as a leader of students,  could give a wonderful performance over the everyday work of the young league. Not only did he tell us how to work, but some specific ideas and experiences he thought would do help us enhance our quality of work and standard of living. He discerned that college student should pay more attention to everyday exercise, which would strengthen our body enabling us to be more energetic in college life.</p><p>I am continuously thinking about what the school sincerely want to make us understand because I think this school is sufficiently prepared by all of the teachers who want us to make difference in our college life. I meditate a lot, until I think I superficially understand the perception that the school wants to convey to us. This essay is named Future-st versus Future by me, partially because I think it’s what I want to say about the perception I get from the school. Mr. Bing says that we should consider issues on a world-scale perspective, thinking more about the future instead of being trapped in everything that happens in nowadays, which is a key point that influences the promising career of a student. It doesn’t matter that you have no ideas because it’s difficult for everyone to imagine the future world exactly, because no one is prophet, but it’s a pity that you don’t have the courage to have a try on a field you never reach, even if you didn’t need to do anything but think.<br>Think about future-st. Think about our future.</p><h3 id="Dairy-Four"><a href="#Dairy-Four" class="headerlink" title="Dairy Four"></a><center><i>Dairy Four</i></center></h3><p>Although I have known several days ago that the astronomic essays translated by our official account group would be published on the Netease website, it is very cool to see our words <em>for this first time is my words</em> in our own cell phones when I browsed the website. It’s unbelievable when I receive the ensured massages sent by the Netease editors. I have been feeling unbelievable until now..Although I think I use the wrong tense, It’s all right.</p><p>Now I think I am lucky and exhilarated to lead this kind of fulfilled life. I can write the essays I love to share with all interested in them and also can earn some money to complement my pocket money, without any interruption to my own study and multitude of spare-time activities. Just a part time job and I just need to enjoy. And to be honest, I don’t care how much money I can get. I just feel delighted when more and more passages written by me can be appreciated by more and more people, letting them know the glamour of cosmos and the latest developments. This is enough for me. Years ago I’m not capable of interpreting to write those to people and just able to read them in some magazines introducing the readers some general knowledge, but now I can do it myself and make others better understand NASA’s and Science’s and Nature’s, which is squarely a tremendous progress for me. I just want to insist on my goals and do some self-encouragement. Come on, teenagers! <em>I am not a teenager?</em></p><p>I never believe that I can make an English presentation in my metrology and surveying course, but finally I make it. At first, I really don’t want to challenge myself so much, because although I am confident for my oral English, I have never given a lecture in front of class in Chinese, not to mention in English, for I sometimes may feel very nervous by instinct on a big stage. However this time I think it is so boring if I say Chinese as our work is translation which means we don’t have so many things to be reported to the whole class just needing to present our document, an instruction book about the computer programming guide of a laser scanner, and demonstrate how to use it. Sophisticated as the guide is, I think it is not sufficient and there must be something difficult for us to finish in the final presentation to prove that we are truly proficient about the interaction between Chinese and English. It’s lucky that I don’t make a lot of grammatical and pronouncing mistakes. Although in the future I will do more English pres like this, in my retrospect, the very first time of my first English presentation is 2017.12.13, the date I will remember forever, so of commemoration. The best enjoyable thing for a student even a man is challenging himself again and again and pursuing more and more perfection in his career, isn’t it? I think if you dare not do that today, you will not be brave to do that in the future.</p><p>This week, I received my scholarship. But I don’t know how to use it because my pocket money is abundant for me. Maybe I will buy some shares or deposit in the banks.<br>Final exam weeks will come soon. A lot of ddl-s will “plague” me and I am entangled in countering all of them with a SMILE icon. I’m looking forward to the winter vacation!</p><p>Oh. Having heard that CNU won the top prize in the competition of GIS skills among college students, I’m so proud of them, who are junior and senior mates. As a sophomore, maybe I will make efforts to in the future be enrolled in the competition and emmm, good night.</p><p><img src="/images/third-blog/3.jpg" alt></p><h3 id="Dairy-Five"><a href="#Dairy-Five" class="headerlink" title="Dairy Five"></a><center><i>Dairy Five</i></center></h3><p>It is an uncanny week for me when there are subsequent blows to me one by one, some of which make me feel very lucky and of rapture, while others are so bittersweet. </p><p>The first thing is the retirement ceremony of Kobe’s Jersey. Like thousands of hundreds of Kobe’s fans, I couldn’t help tear streaming during the whole sacred ceremony. I think I need use “sacred” to depict my feeling. Having heard about him in the primary school, I suppose he has a tremendous impact on me. Last semester when I was taking English Practicing 2 class, I made a short video about Kobe, including his aspiration to me, his Mamba spirit influence on me, which is so impressionable to my English teacher. I think he sets such a good example for all of us, letting his fans know how hardworking a man can be and how successful one’s career can be due to his unfailing effort. He thanked all of his fans, his families and his teammates for their endless support. And when the boss of Lakers team read the replies his fans presented to Kobe on twitter, tears lingered in their eyes. They are so honorable to witness that kind of commemorative moment, as well as me. </p><p>The second thing is to appreciate the lecture held in BNU by two laureates of Nobel Prizes awarded by the unprecedented discovery of the gravitational waves. I feel as if I were following them to recall the nascent period of time when they insisted on the impossibility of the plan to construct the Ligo detector at the very first time because they thought that the detection of the signals in such a trivial scale like 10-18 was unbelievable. But as the high-tech detective method got developed, they gradually agreed with this idea and finally, the final success shows the advent of the new era of astronomy where lots of different kinds of sources indicating the happen on one specific phenomenon can be discovered by radio telescope, visible light telescope and even gravitational waves detectors. Among the most important 10 scientific events unveiled by the World Science magazine, the grand finale of Cassini and the multi-signal astronomy are on the rank, which I’m extremely proud of as a student who has an affection on that kind of subject.Sometimes I will speculate that the tools of studying astronomy are somehow related to remote sensing because they use the radio wavelength and the high-energetic wavelength like gamma rays, while traditional remote sensing uses the complementary electromagnetic spectrum. It is such a coincidence for me to have the opportunity to know more about both of them, but to some extent it is an inevitable thing because essentially they both make most of the radiation.</p><p>When watching the lecture, I have a strong feeling on the vitality of regarding English as a useful tool besides an extremely crucial language. One can’t fully understand the content of lecture if not able to excel at the listening skills as the speed of lecturers’ saying English is so fast. So maybe this is a motivation for me to make it.<br>The third thing is that I have almost finished the task of digitally drawing the isoline. For me, it is a vivid process where I can search for information about the instruction of GIS software myself and manipulate all kinds of geospatial data on my laptop. While scanning a map can only help vectorize all polyline data in the map, the most needed procedure is to create a geographic field in the attribute table to make data represent specialized geographic meanings, otherwise it would have become a plain polyline without any of meaning on other aspects. The old says goes that practice makes perfect. Although I don’t think I do the whole work in a very convenient way, I attain lots of knowledge on vector data editing, which is helpful for me to better conceive how those data are organized in a very efficient way.</p><p>The fourth thing is I revise my test paper of remote sensing course in the midterm exam with the help of our assistant instructor. It is vital for me to know drawbacks in my study to prompt me to have a little progress every day.<br>The fifth thing is my elective English major ends in this week. Although I have experienced that kind of life in just one short semester, I firmly think it deserves my perseverance because I really gain a lot. I knew how to pronounce well in a standardized British accent and how to write a structured essay, which is beneficial to my future long-term development. I love it. The teacher are all sensible and conscientious and kind-hearted!</p><p>I will embrace weeks fraught with exams.Just hope I can pass the linear algebra exam as my midterm exam mark is zero. Also I will say farewell to 2018 next week, maybe I will write a long essay to remind me of the pros and cons of my life in 2017 and look forward to the next year.</p><h3 id="Memoir-in-2017-and-Expectations-in-2018"><a href="#Memoir-in-2017-and-Expectations-in-2018" class="headerlink" title="Memoir in 2017 and Expectations in 2018"></a><center><i>Memoir in 2017 and Expectations in 2018</i></center></h3><p>It seems the passage of time is transient when I am enjoying the college life. At the approximate moment of the last day in 2016 I remembered clearly that I was in front of my computer in my mom’s home writing something happening in 2016 and looking forward to all I would like to do in the new year, while now I am still in front of my new computer in my grandparents’ new home writing something occurring in 2017 and also hope to encounter something with beauty and intriguing scenarios. It’s so similar, isn’t it? One differentiation is at the current time I write this passage in English, perhaps because I’ve fostered an instinct of saying English in my everyday college life. Although I have experienced everything in 2017, I just would like to become a beholder to let me know what truly happened in this year. Everyone will say they hope their life is fulfilling, thereby how about mine?</p><p>Oh as I mentioned just now, I am writing a new memoir on my new computer in my new home, maybe one of the keywords for my life in 2017 is new. Every day for me is a new day, which maybe is a waste sentence. However, I speculate this sentence reflects a very cheerful mindset and attitude towards my next consecutive day. Even if it will be 2018.1.1 tomorrow, it’s just an ostensible day of special meaning but actually a normal day as any one of the days I have experienced. I can’t demand something special during that new day, maybe receiving some wishes from my intimate friends and preparing rigorously for my final exam, especially linear algebra. But I truly hope I will marry what I suppose is compelling and new to me. It’s that kind of thing that renders me to be exhilarated and ecstatic every day and not to be so tedious about my life. This is my empiricism when I need to surmount the ordeals and I hope I can continue to live and produce my individual value according to that methodology. New year, new life, new things, new perspective.</p><p>The second keyword is academic. In order to write this memoir, I browse my gallery on my phone, which stores all the pictures I have taken in the whole 2017 at the expense of a 64GB SD card. To my surprise, pictures related to the academic roughly account for 40% whilst those related to the astronomic 30% and others are of various aspects, which makes me recall carefully what I have witnessed in 2017 and finally understand the reason why the ridiculous phenomenon is caused. We visited RADI and Beijing Bureau of Surveying and Mapping and other remote-sensing-oriented institutes in our winter vacation as wells as Universities in Shenzhen and Hong Kong during our summer vacation in our summer vacation, during all of which I took lots of photos about landscapes and academic information that I was interested in. So it’s univocal that I have so many photos like this. And in this semester I have extra classes in an extremely eminent university, which contributes to my photo collection and is really meaningful.</p><p>The third keyword is practicing. Last term I went to Beidaihe to practice recognizing kinds of rock with my major mates, including sedimentary rock and igneous rock and metamorphic rock, also making a terrain analysis and a geometric analysis. For geography it’s paramount to practice for several times in the real situation, just a saying goes that one should practice in nature to understand the science of the earth.Besides pragmatically reviewing what we have been imparted with high preoccupation, we also have a paradisaical memory during this kind of play-to-learn process. I have intrepidly rushed out of a flies-molested dune, subsequently named as flies mountain by us, a magic name. My feet have softly touched by the ocean in the beach in Beidaihe and I heard that a teacher teaching the neighboring class was tragically thrown in the shallow seawater with a broad smile which was somewhat unbelievable and anti-intuition. I hope we can practice for another new geographic subject in 2018.</p><p>The fourth keyword is paying-off. It’s not a physical paying-off but mental. I received lots of scholarship in 2017, bespeaking that what I have done in 2017 in both works and studies is effective and validated by others. Maybe someone would say that the school work is so time-consuming that it has a deleterious impact on the academic career, but I think it can make me better because my skills of time arrangement and management has been significantly improved by all solutions which I endeavored to come up with to address the time mismatch between my work and studies and eventually I can try my best to do well in two sides. At the very beginning, it was a hard task with obvious prudence and proficiency that you should have armed contemporaneously, but whilst getting accustomed to the relentless tasks and dealing with them very efficiently, I think I’m maturer than previous me. The astronomic club is also my most favorite. I can make good fellowship with others, and contact with other counterparts in other universities. Prospering it my achieving goal and motto. Also, I will try to maintain my translating group to make it a tradition and good part of our Wechat Official Account and Netease News.</p><p>In the new year, I will try to reach the higher GPA and follow my instructor to develop our scientifically researched project. It’s challenging for all of the undergraduates besides me, but I think I’m obsessed in this field of study combining computer science with geo-spatiotemporal data, as well as database and algorithm, which will be a solid underpinning for my project realization. And maybe I will retire from my astronomic club and enjoy all the precious and priceless time it brings to me. It’s a golden year with so much possibility and pure imagination and I just want to relish it day by day.<br>All of the memories in 2017 will be buried and commemorated in the deep of my mind and all of the imminent moments in 2018 will ‘mesmerize’ me deeply in my heart. 2018 is approaching! </p><p><img src="/images/third-blog/6.jpg" alt></p><h3 id="The-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Its-Influence-on-Geospatial-Data-Analysis"><a href="#The-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Its-Influence-on-Geospatial-Data-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="The Artificial Intelligence and Its Influence on Geospatial Data Analysis"></a><center><i>The Artificial Intelligence and Its Influence on Geospatial Data Analysis</i></center></h3><p>AI is a very magic word for the general public and since its very first debut in 2016 when Alpha Go won Li Shishi in the well-recognized Go game, AI went viral on the Internet and maybe all the people knew this “coinage”. The increasingly developing technology makes the assist of AI to the geospatial data analysis more possible than before. For example, AI is used in the big data analysis, which means AI can also be utilized in the geospatial data analysis for, in essence, the geospatial data is somehow equivalent to the big data, but with the supplementary that geospatial data adds something geographic and spatial. This is the discrepancy between geospatial data and the big data, but if we consider the superfluous geographic and spatial data as the concomitant data of the traditional concept of big data, it’s pragmatic to use AI as a tool to manipulate.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine how AI influences our word beyond our recognition. As was mentioned in the class, the manless car is a masterpiece of using AI-embedded system to detect the blockages in the street including trees, houses and the most important, pedestrians. The kind of AI it uses is neural network. I find it interesting when searching for information on the Internet, and the neural network does make sense in terms of assist. When a driver initially drove a car to guide it passing a narrow road, the screen in the car demonstrating how the AI read the data derived from the sensor and compared the data to the predicted result showed us the similarity between the reality and the predicted data in a visualization way———using a diagram with two pillars whose length are mutable when the similarity changes. Therefore we could clearly see how the BP neural network influenced the motion of the car. The car’s driving by itself with the steering wheel spinning without human’s help is quite marvellous.</p><p>For remote sensing and geographical information science that we have learned, AI is an excellent tool too. For remote sensing, the remotely sensed image equates itself to a matrix, if regarding the DN of pixel as the member of a matrix with the same resolution. But there is a difference between remotely sensed image and usual image that remotely sensed image has lots of spectral information, usually depicted as N dimensional spectral space. So the image processing is far more difficult than the processing of usual image as we endeavor to make all of information, not only in visible but also invisible, well organized. So comes AI.</p><p>A recently published paper shows how to classify water and nonwater using particle swarm optimization. Using Landsat 8 spectral image to derive the spectral curves per pixel and comparing the standard spectral curve of water, the initial possibility of water per pixel is parameterized by the cosine value between the water spectral vector value and the corresponding ground object value times the distant value that the scholars define. Then the entire image is segmented to pieces and we can use the particle swarm optimization to update the possibility of water with hundreds of iteration. Then the highly possible area is considered as water and the lower area nonwater. Comparing this newly developed method with traditional ones using for classification <em>K-means, IsoData, SVM</em>, the author tells us it has the highest median KC with lowest fluctuation. I am quite shocked when I come up with the almost same idea when encountering the neural network, but what I speculate is using neural network and the comparison of spectral curve to achieve the spatial-temporal data-integration goals. Assuming that the spectral curve is the same in terms of the same ground object, so if acquiring two images in the same position and the same time, but one is higher spatial resolution and lower temporal and the other is opposite, so myriad pairs of such image can be considered as training set, and the weighted number for each spectrum can be ungraded so finally the weighted number can be used to match the pair of images in the other position. </p><p>Just reminiscent of our class taught by Shi Chen last semester, he said Principle Component Analysis was a very useful data-processing tool for remotely sensed image. PCA is also kind of AI method, which uses the feature vector, if N times N image, to extract the most important information in the multispectral space. However the feature vector exists only under the N times N circumstance, so if M times N, maybe Singular Value Degradation is more adoptable. The first element of the diagonal matrix contains the most important information about the image, and we can reverse the whole process to obtain what we want.<br>To identify the clouds in a MSD image, the fuzzy logic method and the neural network are used. I concede that I cannot understand the details about the process. But maybe we can acknowledge that AI is inextricably connected with the modern technology of remote sensing and geospatial data analysis.</p><p>So maybe the AI heralds the era of evolution in the signal processing and data analysis. And we should embrace this advancement because it means the advent of nascent high-tech technology and the groundbreaking work for all the nature science. To discover and To unearth the magic breakthrough and to apply it to the applications that have a profound impact on our society is what we can sincerely expect and explore.</p><h3 id="Prologue-A-Course-Final"><a href="#Prologue-A-Course-Final" class="headerlink" title="Prologue -> A Course Final"></a><center><i>Prologue -> A Course Final</i></center></h3><p>Today, I eventually finish all the tasks included in this semester project, feeling ecstatic. I have already tried to surmount all the difficulties for 2 months. Although I have encountered some of them in the practising classes imparted by Prof. Greene, other new problems appeared to battle me one by one. For a student who enrolled in the elective class called Paper Searching and Analysis this term, I learned lots of methods that could help me search for useful information in the searching engine, CNKI, and other databases, so I tried to pursue the answers myself. </p><p>But sometimes when I’m capsized in the devoid self-searching-information process, I will ask for teacher’s help, who really do me a favor. During the whole reconstructing process, I have a more profound understanding of the essence of GIS software, combining some basic concepts of geoscience such as projection transformer and so on, but the most important, with some later manly-inserted geographic data. And how to deal with all kinds of attributes, what’s the meaning of topology in the geo-processing except for the real mathematical one, and the solutions of all relevant questions are the most precious knowledge I have attained in this process.</p><p><strong><center>Georeferencing</center></strong></p><p>In Greene’s class we have resolved how to match two related images by adding ground control points using the georeferencing tool. But for the situation pinpointing to the georeferencing tool, the answer is still unknown. When I first opened the map image and found the precise intersection of latitude and longitude, I once thought this is an easy question, for I just needed to repeat the procedure which I felt I was proficient in, which was utterly wrong. I confidently started the tool and added the point but finally realized there was no image for me to match! What should I do? Desperately I right clicked my mouse because when I did that, usually a big surprise came. So it was. A submenu appeared, giving me two options, including adding the X,Y coordinates and adding the latitude and longitude, which was disabled. I tried to figure out why it was disabled and finally knew it was because this is a image with no geographic reference. So I open the layer’s properties and assigned it a Mercator coordinate system. As is expected, I could add the latitude and longitude, which made me understand the essence of georeferencing and the idiosyncrasy of geographic data. I added 10 points and endeavored to make the deviation smaller.</p><p><strong><center>Geodatabase</center></strong></p><p>Actually, in the first attempt to create a isoline feature, I didn’t read the instruction, which led to an establishment of shp format data. However according to the instruction I needed to create a database which contained line feature class. Why? What is the difference between two ways? I searched online and found it could be explained by the development of GIS, which former created shp later created updated database which could store the relationship and topology of different classes, which shp format didn’t function. So I created a new database and began to draw the isoline automatically. Arcscan was critically needed in this complicated work. I scanned the whole map and began to amend and correct the mistakes, which is the process where I gradually knew how to edit vector data by editors. For some easy operations like merger and split and delete, I just used the tool happily, but when I incorrectly merged lines which resulted in a redundant subtle line branched at somewhere in the long contour line, I began to use advanced tool called explosion <em>in situ</em> to make the line decompose, and deleted the subtle line to rectify. Also I think the selection tools called select by polygon and select by line are of extremely good use because I don’t need to merge the lines two by two but create a polygon encompassing them or create a line linking any of their vertex together to select all of the line features. It truly helped me a lot when I learned to edit vector. The saying goes that practice makes perfect. I confess that at the very first time I was confused by 100000+ lines in the attributes table, but as I knew how to merge, how to select, how to delete, and how to add field, which I would mention later, thing got easier and easier.<br>When I tried to finish this procedure, I pondered how to give all the lines their unique meaning of geography. Because when I created one features, even if I coordinated them, they would only have 2-dimensional meanings of X and Y. How to add the elevation information puzzled me a lot. I recalled the experimental process in Greene’s class when I opened an attributes table where the location of places and the population of places were displayed. Soon I meditated what was the functionality of geodata which maybe was superficial. All the lines just were the visualization of graphics, just like CAD. But a differentiation was data in GIS contained geographic information but CAD didn’t. This was the knowledge in the first slide of GIS class narrating the comparison between GIS and CAD, but only in a pragmatic way did I truly got what it truly was. So I added the field as I had done in Greene’s class and then added all elevation information for corresponding merged contour line. Frankly speaking, when I finally created TIN, what GIS required indicated that I had forethought. Attribute was mandatory so I assigned the elevation rigorously to the field, which rendered me to touch the glamour of TIN’s beauty.<br>For all of other features, I just repeated the above procedures just like computational loop <em>I needed to add different fields into different data, which meaned scene was specific</em>. But when first creating features, I needed to set the same coordinate system as layer, which corroborated the topological relationship.</p><p><strong><center>Configure a map? Interesting!</center></strong></p><p>In the layout view, we can construct a map. I just need to open the Insert menu and insert compass, map scale, name, author, date to the map. A lots of interesting discoveries include how to use the text script to adjust the size of the characters and how to set the page’s width and length by using proper template.</p><p><strong><center>When displayed in ArcScene....</center></strong></p><p>Contour is used to create TIN hence TIN is used to create DEM thus DEM is used to create the aspect and slope map, which is the workflow of 3D terrain analysis. Although the range is continuous when firstly created, we can convert it into discrete by setting classification and display it colorful in the ArcGis. But when I add it to ArcScene and freely appreciate it, my adrenalin surges.</p><p><strong><center>Avoid mistakes, use topology.</center></strong></p><p>When first learning topology in GIS class, I was stunned by its beauty in math, but I didn’t truly understand what it represented in the field of geography. Instructed by guides in Baidu, I created a feature dataset including road layer and topology, but topological rules dizzied me. It not only contains basic intersection, contain, within,overlay and so on, but some compound rules mingling some of them. So I searched online again to know what all of those were about and knew the empirical meaning of topology for geography. I used no overlay and no pseudo nodes rules and created a topology. For example, for a pipeline that transfers the water to places, intersection can help analysis and find the mistake which is aided in our amendment.</p><p><strong><center>Conclusion</center></strong></p><p>Through this reconstructing process, I experience how to digitally make a replica of scanned map and almost review everything I learned in the GIS class both theoretically and practically, which is very meaningful.</p><h3 id="No-Title"><a href="#No-Title" class="headerlink" title="No Title"></a><center><i>No Title<i></i></i></center></h3><p>I’m truly a person who are unwilling to spread what I think is a so-called minus-energy thing, namely pessimistic information in some social platforms including WeChat. But what happened yesterday made me so sorrowful that it surpassed the threshold of melancholy I could bear. In order not to be entirely self-destructed, I chose to write a message to relieve myself. Things I experienced during recent days were of bad luck. Since I couldn’t escape, I overcame by myself. However, I was totally moved, when someone called me in WeChat. I realized that lots of real friends were paying attention to me and my mental health, protecting me from self-degradation.</p><p>It’s 0:45 now. Just almost 24 hours ago, I receive a message sent by one, who in order to protect the privacy I will say is anonymous. </p><p>How are you feeling now? You shouldn’t be distracted and discouraged by those things. It’s just bad luck for you to endure those unfortunate damn things otherwise you shouldn’t go through. Tomorrow is better, believe me. CET4 isn’t all for your life, don’t be desperate…..</p><p>Unexaggeratedly speaking, I almost felt the odor of my tears when raising my phone again attempting to make a callback. And I don’t know how to respond. It gave me such momentum to rebuild the ability to think confidently of myself and to make the resurgence of my passion for bodily life. It’s widely accepted a person will be mentally weak in the evening or at midnight when being grief-stricken during the day. And I don’t know whether I will collapse due to the state of my mind yesterday, which is so perilous. I couldn’t do anything but appreciate her.</p><p>Abruptly I am reminiscent of the book called the Birth of Tragedy I recently read with the help of a friend majored in philosophy. Apollo and Dionysian represent rationality and wild will respectively. The collision in my mind yesterday is like the fight between two spirits. I tried to weather the storm that could engulf me into the whole corpse, but eagerly want to achieve the goal that rationality outperforms the feeling of out-of-control following my wild will. The catalyst that helped me make tactical sense was the message, a precious message that I should cherish forever.</p><p>Relinquishing MIT projects is a very intertwined decision. I don’t feel pity to make it because I think the regionally geographical practice held by our department is preferential. Also, I contemplate maybe going to MIT with the cost of paying lots of money isn’t my ideal dream. I need to enhance my own competitiveness to embrace the next chance I will sweetly encounter in the future. Going to Hangzhou, Yangzhou to visit the Dayunhe cultural heritage is also perfect.</p><p>There’s some breakthrough in my own research projects. For the project related to WIFI, we have finished constructing the 3D model of our campus, leading to the future application. For the project of deep learning, I have read lots of references and my instructor ordered me to share a paper published in Science with other symposium mates. Excitedly endeavoring to do that, I suppose it’s a tremendous confirmation of my instructor to my ability in scientific research. With time transpiring, I realize I experience my own metamorphosis from an amateurish in deep learning who almost understand nothing to a student that can make efforts to finish my own artificial intelligence. That’s cool!  </p><p><img src="/images/third-blog/8.jpg" alt></p><h3 id="About-English-Learning"><a href="#About-English-Learning" class="headerlink" title="About English Learning"></a><center><i>About English Learning</i></center></h3><p>Sincerely suggest that if you think you excel at English or have very high grade(s) of one or two standardized qualified test, for example, TOEFL 110+ or CET4/6 600+, neglect this passage, because I know there are lots of excellent students in my WeChat circle achieving this goal and will be afraid that what I say in this passage subjectively can lead to your misconception about English study. I’m just a plain student wanting to share with you. Because today I have finished my last English class in college career, so-called the 4th level of college English. A brief recalling about my experience of learning English.</p><p>Until now I realize that English is just a medium of cultural and linguistic communication, but because it’s widely used ubiquitously, we should assiduously study it thus making us speak English fluently with foreigners to express our notions explicitly. I always feel very lucky to have been imparted by many very learned English teachers during the stage of my high school career. Until now do I realize that the most important thing in intermediate English education is that not only do we need to learn more about the English itself, but we also should obtain what’s more advantageous in our formation of benevolent personal traits and high morality. Although we always complain about doing so much reading tasks and writing so much, we are sometimes neglectful of the fact that all we read is just passages conveying information in English and in fact, connotations and meaningful opinions pertaining to the information are paramount to our future development, which teach us how to act to specific solutions, how to deal with plights when confronting. English is just a medium, a very pragmatic and empirical medium to help us yield things in the future. What makes me ecstatically is my English teachers know that profoundly and not only tell us through voluminous passages, but also behave by themselves. In my retrospective, when I was preparing for college entrance exam, Mrs Wu blamed me for utilizing so much time to ask her some questions about reading regardless of other students’ thought and unhappiness. Actually she was telling me how to harmoniously make a solid rapport with classmates and take their feeling for consideration. It’s such a precious moment I think to reveal the generic and intrinsic ideas about what English study really gives us as a gift.</p><p>My college English teachers are erudite. The volume of their seas of knowledge is unfathomable. Having gained a 140-grade from my <em>gaokao</em> English test, undoubtedly I endure a stage where I think MY ENGLISH IS FAIRLY EXCELLENT AMONG OTHERS, but ensuing things prove it totally wrong. First English class we were asked to hand in a translation from Chinese to English. A phrase is “美化环境”, which I think is very normally and elegantly to be translated into “beautify the environment”. Mr. Zhu saw my translation with a secret smile, saying that my translation was good but not very good. Unbelievable of the assessment he gave me, I asked why and finally revered him very much. Every class I will listen very carefully for fear that I missed something important. He told us how to use word “calling” and phrase “hold water”, which impressed me most. Such an excellent usage of English expression intrigued me so much. Only through the communication about how to study English well with him do I perceive that never too old to learn English and that learning English at college is just another foot of a high mountain. </p><p>At the current level where my vocabulary is 16000+ and I can read lots of so-called original work and scientific papers, I can have a deeper understanding of the beauty of English. At first, when I read The brief history of Tomorrow, I was dismayed by my inability to read very fast due to the presence of lots of GRE words, so I began to recite all GRE words and try to take advantage of them in my own writing. My English teacher once said to me that the usage of GRE words was so scarce that once not engaged in that test one didn’t need to recite. Initially, I didn’t believe that but until now I ensure it. I just come across lots of GRE words in some socioeconomic books and historical books and GRE test and forget lots of GRE words when urging to use them. But learning lots of new words is a tantalizing thing. What is the most important is that you can feel the beauty of English thanks partially to remembering new words. I read a passage before reading that the number of mostly used English words are 2000+ and other words are used to complement the ideas or pursue the more elaborate meaning of expressing more emotionally and rationally. If reading lots of magazine such as the Guardian or the Economist, you can fully understand the authors’ attitude in the form of sarcasm and optimism and so on not just understand the content of the passage. Also I highly recommend reading original books, because every translation works are interspersed with translators’ understanding or entirely superseded by.
